OPERATIVE NOTES
CPB 2 h 45 m    XC 1 h 30 m    CA h m    My Role
Incision: median Sternotomy
Grafts used Left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to LADs, and Saphenous vein grafts to RCA, OM1, and diagonal branch.
Findings: Extensive calcifications of Coronary arteries noted. Successful harvesting of the LIMA and Saphenous veins with no intraoperative complications


Post-operative Course

Initial recovery: Uneventful, transferred into ICU, maintained on mechanical ventilation for 1 hour. Post-OP        
Monitoring: hemodynamics remained stable. No significant arrhythmias observed. Extracted successfully after 6 hours.
Medications: initiated on anticoagulants and beta-blockers post-OP
Outcome: Patient was oriented on POD2, discharged to Step-down unit on POD2


Learning Points, Key Lessons

Gained hands-on experience with laparoscopic thyroidectomy.

Understood the importance of intraoperative monitoring during CPB to detect early signs of hemodynamic instability.

Learned effective communication with the OR team for smooth management during high stress periods of the surgery.
